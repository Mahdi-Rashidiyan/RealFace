# Render Deployment Guide for RealFace

## Deployment Issue Fixed

The application was encountering issues during deployment on Render due to PyTorch and its CUDA dependencies. The logs showed that Render was attempting to download large CUDA libraries which are unnecessary for deployment on Render's free tier, which doesn't support GPU acceleration.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated requirements.txt**:
   - Changed PyTorch dependencies to CPU-only versions:
     - `torch==2.7.0+cpu` (instead of `torch==2.7.0`)
     - `torchvision==0.22.0+cpu` (instead of `torchvision==0.22.0`)
   - Fixed encoding issues in the file

2. **Modified AI model code**:
   - Updated `detector/ai_model.py` to force CPU usage instead of trying to use CUDA
   - Simplified model loading to always use CPU

3. **Updated training code**:
   - Modified `detector/models/train_model.py` to use CPU for training

## Why These Changes Work

Render's free tier doesn't support GPU acceleration, so attempting to use CUDA libraries was causing deployment failures. By switching to CPU-only versions of PyTorch and ensuring the application code doesn't try to use CUDA, we've made the deployment process more efficient and compatible with Render's environment.

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Model Size**: Be mindful of the size of your trained model files. Large model files can cause deployment issues or slow down your application.

2. **Memory Usage**: Monitor your application's memory usage on Render, as the free tier has memory limitations.

3. **Environment Variables**: Consider adding a `TORCH_CPU_ONLY` environment variable in your `render.yaml` to make it easier to toggle between CPU and GPU modes if you later upgrade to a paid tier.

4. **Caching**: Implement caching for model predictions to reduce computational load, especially important when using CPU-only inference.
